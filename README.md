# Microgrids.JuMP

An experimental code for microgrid sizing optimization using an algebraic formulation ([implemented with JuMP](https://jump.dev/)), rather than a simulator-based formulation (e.g. with [Microgrids.jl](https://github.com/Microgrids-X/Microgrids.jl))

âš  This code corresponds to an unpublished, experimental formulation. It lives in this repository for sharing with colleagues, but is  *not meant for public reuse!* 

Dependencies: 

- [Microgrids.jl](https://github.com/Microgrids-X/Microgrids.jl)

The outcome of this code with used in my [flash talk about anticipativity](https://forum.openmod.org/t/grenoble-workshop-2024-lightning-talks/4438/34) at the [Openmod workshop 2024 in Grenoble](https://forum.openmod.org/t/grenoble-workshop-2024-registration-and-details/4350).
